-------------

**There's this Pokéstop/Gym near me which seems inappropriate. Can I report it?**

Use [this](http://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=319928) link. However, Niantic seems to be preoccupied with other things now, so don't expect too much.

We have Niantic representatives on both here and /r/TheSilphRoad - please **do not** ping them for bugs which are in the known issues page unless you have found a niche yet gamebreaking issue/exploit.

--------------

**Where can I find other players in my area?**

Try our [regional subreddits list](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/wiki/regionalsubs)! Also, see the [related subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/wiki/relatedsubreddits) or [TSR's community map](https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/)!

All I ever see in the wild are base stage commons and Generation 3 and 4 starters, so please Niantic, make  evolved Pokémon spawn again!

So i basically stopped after the first summer of pokemon go. Rural town so less stops and gyms. Luckilly we got some... Also the gym system back then meant the gyms were too high for me. At my current job 2 colleagues are playing pokemon go. So i thought why not start it up again. Turns out being a delivery driver with a pokemon go plus works like a charm. i stopped at lvl 22 now almost lvl 24.

The gym and coin strategy.

What is the best gym strategy for coins? Or what do you do? Since the max coins per day are just 50. I just try to look for gyms from my team and put a decent but not great pokemon in a empty slot. And if i have enough potions and revives i battle a enemy gym down, and put a decent but not great pokemon in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eggs.

Are eggs from friends more likely to have nice(r) pokemons in them? At the moment i go for the friend eggs first if not possible a 10km egg if also not possible a 5km egg if also not possible the 2 km egg. Is that a good strategy, and why or why not? What is you egg strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

Raids.

I only did one so far. Are raids doable for a solo player? Some raids have 1 symbol some have up to 4 symbols on them. Does that mean the difficulty? Does that scale up the reward?

I wanted to leave some thoughts and constructive criticism over how the two events ran. \n\n- There was a greater variety of exclusive spawns at Chicago. Absol, Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix spawned in the wild, allowing more people to get these pokemon that are normally raid or egg only. I know level 1 collectors were excited about shiny Absol and Mawile. Both were available at Chicago, only Mawile available in Dortmund. Wild togetics were also very plentiful in Chicago and missing from Dortmund.  It felt as though they removed some of these exclusive spawns and didn't replace them with anything else creative/exciting. Also, cranidos was a very rare spawn even in the rock biome. \n\n- While not a problem for most trainers was hoping that the unown letters would differ between the GoFests.\n\n- Higher amount of stops at Dortmund.\n\n- Very few contests were based on overall trainer strength, at both GoFests but especially in Dortmund. Lots of people winning based on the weight of a pokemon, doing a good pokemon impersonation, having the lowest amount of candy of a species, or just being in the right time and place and having a shirt thrown into the crowd. This was definitely up to the individual running the contest but it felt like very few questions were asked geared towards rewarding more experienced players. I'm all for spreading the love around, but I do feel like a higher percentage of the contests should be based on effort put into the game.\n\n- Experienced more service interruptions. Had lots of friends with the same impression \xa0Was on one network (T-Mobile) in chicago, two different networks in Dortmund (deutsche Telekom and Vodafone).\n\n- Westfalen is beautiful! And the park is enormous. Was much more intense walking the entirety of park. Was a very nice setting to have host the park. Grant park in Chicago is a lot simpler in terms of landscape. \n\n- The biome areas were much simpler build wise at Dortmund, making them a little less visually apparent and fun.\n\n- The park was possible to play in for a player who did not have their GoFest day in Dortmund. The original stops present in the park were still available and stops could be lured. In Chicago the park was essentially wiped clean.\n\n- Dortmund is a nice, quaint town, with easy access to other cities surrounding, though Chicago itself has  more to offer as a host city, in my opinion.\n\nSecurity\n\n\n- No security checks in Chicago, no wait lines. No requirement to start as a specific gate. In Chicago the gates felt like more of suggestion in an attempt to spread out the players rather than a rigid rule. This works so much better. In Dortmund every gate had security restricting access. \xa0Had security split up a group, requiring people to walk at least 30 mins around the park to an alternate entrance. Saw a green/blue shellos spawn just outside a gate and had to have my bags checked again to re-enter. Also, because if the bag checks, there were often long lines waiting to enter the park. This was non-existent at Chicago. This might be a requirement of the park itself, but definitely negatively affected my experience at Dortmund. \n\n- No Cameras Allowed. Had a security guard tell me that my small mirrorless camera was not allowed, and I should leave and pretend like I put my camera in my car and return as if didn't have it anymore. No guard had an issue with the same camera on a previous day, and only the one guard had this issue despite multiple re-entries on Saturday. \n\n- No chance for friends in different days to mingle in the park itself. Had several friends who wanted to meet each other who had separate days, security would not allow entry on your off day. While the argument can me made to limit the amount of cell signals in the park, I think in practice the amount of people who would go to play in the park without access to the event spawns would be pretty small. And weighed against the chance of meeting a friend from across the world, the open access of Chicago is way, way better. Grant park can be set up to be gated and Niantic made a conscious choice not to. Why the disparity?\n\n- The test raid was essentially limited to Sunday ticket holders. Security prevented players from entering, stating the park was closed even as the gyms were just appearing. The raid was possible to do for ticket holders of all days at Chicago.\n\n- While I understand some of the rules and regulations, my main issue is that at Dortmund these rules were not consistently applied. Had one security at a gate mention I should only enter at my specific gate, and also state that it didn't reach matter at all. A different guard did not allow entry into the gate at all, even without a line present at the gate. The bizarre instance with my camera also made it seem like the rules were there but didn't need to be applied. This all in cut over an hour out of my GoFest experience, which I paid early access for.\n\n[edit: fixed some spelling and added some more details about spawns]"", 'author_fullname': 't2_otulf', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Comparing two GoFests!

I&amp;#39;ve written to Niantic Support, but there&amp;#39;s still no answer. I miss playing this a little, so please, please Reddit, help! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

The Marketplace would be player-to-player exchanges for items that you can't purchase from the store. So for example: candy in exchange for candy, or candy in exchange for evolution items.  When a player enters the Marketplace, they can post an offer to trade (for example, 100 Ralts candies for 100 Magikarp candies, or 500 Swinub candies for a special evolution item), or agree to accept an existing trade offer.  When a player is posting a trade offer, the player sets their own values for what they want to trade vs what they want to acquire. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, when entering the Marketplace, the player taps on a selection of either ""post a Marketplace offer"" or ""browse existing Marketplace offers.""  When posting a Marketplace offer, the player first selects what item(s) of their own they are willing to trade (candies, evolution items, etc.) and second, the player selects what item(s) they want to acquire.  Then the player has a final chance to review the trade offer before posting it.  You should be able to view your pending Marketplace offers whenever you want, and modify them or remove them.  

&amp;#x200B;

When you are entering the Marketplace as a prospective buyer, you can search for specific items you want or just browse recent posts.  A buyer can tap on a posted trade offer to review it, select ""make this Marketplace trade"" (or something like that), finalize/confirm that they want to make the trade, and then it is complete.  The player who posted the Marketplace trade can get a notification that ""Player123 has accepted your Marketplace trade!"" or something to that effect.  

&amp;#x200B;

A neat aspect of a player-to-player marketplace is that, unlike the store, the value of each transaction is subjective to each player.  If a player really want a trade to happen fast, they can make it very attractive to a prospective buyer by offering something rare or a lot of something not-so-rare in order to entice a buyer to make the trade quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

This player-to-player marketplace can be established so that it would not compete with Niantic's store, so that players cannot trade items available for purchase in-store (no coins, lure, lucky eggs, incense, etc.).  That way Niantic isn't undercutting its own profits, but is adding a feature to the game to make it more fun and increases player-to-player interactions and in-game features.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had this idea pop into my head recently: a Pokemon Go player-to-player marketplace that is completely separate from the in-game store.

We need a bigger complaint thread than ever if this to ever to get attention. This model going forward is going to harm all appearing more frequently events. It all started with horsea being low spawn rates but just not as bad as Nidoran M was. If your advertised pokemon isn't found within every spawn cluster of an event centered around it then something is wrong. I live in a biome where Nidoran M spawn commonly in fact there were more before the actual event. The increased spawns of the event are actually the Go fest spawns while Nidoran M is more uncommon/rare to come across which shouldn't be the case. I felt lied to in this announcement.

I am not asking for community day shiny rates but I thought maybe shiny shuckle for the safari zone was a good balance of keeping it rare and also obtainable if you went out. At least they spawned more frequently. These 2 worldwide go fest events with the advertised pokemon appearing more frequently is by far the worse spawn rate of any event ever. THEY barley if anything were increased but Nidoran was actually decreased for me. I DO NOT want to see this for future go fest events/ safari events going forward which is what I am very afraid of. All 3 days I went out and found 128 nidoran total playing like for 18 hours. I luckily snagged 2 shinies but even then I am not satisfied because finding the actual nidorans WAS NOT FUN. It is almost on the tier of the start of Gen 4 spawns which is ridiculous.

If people don't start speaking up now expect Go fest Japan and other safari Zones to be the same horrible spawn rate experience. If you are going to be silent about it then expect all future events to be nerfed with ""appearing more frequently"" not appearing hardly at all. Is this what you really want to be excited about? Because nothing about these Nidoran spawns were exciting it basically sucked all the fun of shiny checking.

Let me know your thoughts on the SPAWN rates advertised as being increased please. Don't tell me you were able to snag many shinies its about the spawns not about the luck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need a bigger complaint thread than ever if this to ever to get attention.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I be investing in Legendaries or my &amp;quot;strong Pokemon&amp;quot; (Slaking, Salamence, Metagross, Tyranitar, etc). so that I am strong when I am able to do higher raids?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you all spend your Rare Candies?&lt;/p&gt;

With raids lately I’ve started to notice a problem. I can take on level 1-2 raids on my own no problem. And once a day there is usually an opportunity to join a group to take on a level 5 raid for the “legendary of the week”.
But I can never seem to find anyone interested in doing a level 3-4 raid. On frequent occasions I have tried to find people to help take on a Gengar, Machamp, Lapras but yo no avail.

I came up with two possible solutions

1️⃣The first is questionable as to how easy it would be to implement. The incentive here is to have the community join together without impairing players for doing so. So if players join a party for a level 3-4 raid, when the raid is completed, for every player in the raid who did not have the boss in their Pokédex, the players who helped get an extra raid pass. 
E.g: i do not have machamp in my dex. I find four other players who do have machamp in their dex (so they are not particularly interested in the raid) when we complete the raid I get machamp and they all get a free raid pass and as such they haven’t lost out on anything. I do not get the free raid pass because I got machamp in my dex.
Second e.g. if two players do not have machamp in their dex and they find four other players who do, when the raid is over the four players who have machamp get two free raid passes each as a reward for helping other members of their community. 
If all players have machamp in their dex then the raid will be conducted as normal.

2️⃣The second incentive is VERY easy to implement and would definitely drive community involvement at all levels. 
Simply boost the shiny chance for level 3-4. Maybe even go so far as to guarantee 1 shiny to 1 participant of te raid who would be randomly selected on completion of the raid. Of course the downside to this is that eventually enough people will get enough shinies that they no longer have any interest and so the less capable players will once again be abandoned. 

I honestly feel largely alone in my Pokemon community and feel that the game is far more oriented toward the power leveller type of player.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a level 31 trainer who’s not too bothered about IV’s or shinies but does have a preference for kanto region mons.

&lt;p&gt;Is there any chance the Pokémon Go account associated with her email was overwritten? I can&amp;#39;t wrap my head around what might be causing this behavior. I hope it&amp;#39;s just a misremembered email, but she has no other Google accounts, no PTC, and she was unable to recall her FB login (there was no FB account associated with her Gmail). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve submitted a support request to Niantic on her behalf in the meantime, but with language barriers and the fact that I&amp;#39;ll only be in the same country as her for a few more days, so I&amp;#39;m trying to get more insight sooner. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1, 174 shiny eligible checks, no shinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running total:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 - 218&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited about today, went to bed early but barely was able to sleep. Like a kid dreaming for santa.... It was my first go fest (been to some safari zones before). Since Dortmund is not around the corner I had my alarm set to 3:30 AM.

&amp;#x200B;

Alarm clock goes off I wake up and get ready to jump in the car. After a nice car ride of 3 hours (praise German Highways w/o speed limits (on most parts)) I found myself a nice parking spot near the kaiserhain gate entrance. I met up with some friends and made ourselves ready to make a great day and have a lot of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Clock ticks 8 am we're all psyched and people start walking through the park like zombies. I tried to pay some attention to the amount of detail they put up into the decoration. The entrance gate with the Pokemon music was already a good heads start. Got us really into a good vibe. Before I go to a more rant / salty part of this post i'd like to start of with a positive note which truly is the atmosphere. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of detail again was put into decorations. small decorations on lamp posts themed areas which fitted nice to the theme they were representing (yeah that's you badass steel area with boxes of scrap metal and meltan themed nuts). the areas were widely spaced and there was plenty of room to host all the people. Queues were bearable and there was a lot of shadow places and spots to hang out / relax. The water refreshment stations could've been more and better accessible but luckily it wasn't that hot.

&amp;#x200B;

The weather also played a good role. people were friendly and the general feel of the event was good too. Staff was friendly too.

&amp;#x200B;

So to a more serious note... the reason why I decided to quit after today.

&amp;#x200B;

Not soon after the event had started 8:45 to be exact the network started failing to cover the amount of people which were in the area. not just my cell phone but i heard complaints all around from various other people. If Pokemon would at all appear in the app clicking one would just make the pokeball spin indefinitely...after about a minute or 2 the time-out would be reached and if you were lucky you attempt anew. If you closed the app at all it would not go past 50% of the loading progress bar. If this was already happening at 8:45 in a not at all crowded area one could only fear the worst for when the clock would hit 10:00 and the masses would start to roll in..... Which is exactly what happened.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously Niantic have you not learned from last years major (\*&amp;)(\*&amp;ups regarding cell coverage.... i guess not.

&amp;#x200B;

around 1/2 people in my group of 10+ had mobile coverage. the others received the symptoms described above. We struggled with hot spots to get a minimum of coverage across the group. We struggled to get even past 1/5 of the jirachi quest. Simply because the pokemon would not appear. at around 13:00 we finally got back on track with the quest because cell coverage got better. So that's the first part of my complaint. I send this to Niantic support but i'll probably receive a reply like [this user received ....](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/c9xfiq/the_response_i_received_after_over_3_hours_of/)

&amp;#x200B;

So on to today. We finally managed to get towards the Jirachi quest. when AR catching jirachi several people got bugged out and could not catch the damn mon. White screens appeared / or the mon would just not appear in dex after a succesful catch.... as a countermeasure we had to swap accounts / devices around so everyone could catch their mon. By now after 3 years we know the game is far from bug free, but seriously Niantic. get your stuff together for once. 

imagine a little kid unable to catch this very special pokemon.... this was not just an imagination I can tell you... I saw two kids who were unable to catch this mon at the end of today's go fest and several adults too. whether it was not being able to catch the designated mons because of coverage / bugging out on catching and not knowing how to work-around it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my last point which tipped me over the edge to quitting is shiny rates.... I must give a heads-up. My account has really bad RNG and by now i'm used to it. On most Community Days playing active for the full duration I should be lucky if I catch 3-5 shinys where others catch 10+. I don't want to go into a discussion on whether it is true RNG or that some accounts have a better base shiny rate but my bad RNG made me leave the Pokemon Go fest depressed and left out.

so a depiction of distribution of shinies accross our group of 10 +

&amp;#x200B;

08:00 - 12:00 - Highest : 3, Average : 1/2, Me: 0

12:00 - 15:00 - Highest: 8, Average: 5, Me: 1

15:00 - 18:00 - Highest: 15, Average: 10, me: 2 (1 wailmer, 1 anorith (which I already had))

&amp;#x200B;

yes, You've read that correctly... I saw **TWO (\*(\*&amp;@(\*@&amp;$(@\*&amp;@ shinies in 10 hours!** That's even worse than your average commday....

&amp;#x200B;

Depict this to be your go fest experience on shinies. Walking for 10 hours only to hear each and everyone around you in the public (yes that is thousands of people) go like: OMG!!!!! YESSSSSSSS SHINY SANDSHREW.... OMG ANOTHER ONE.... OOOOOOOOOH SHIT SHINY Aerodactyl / onix / whatever mon you desire. I even noticed the people in my group being more or less ashamed to announce they yet again had clicked a shiny xxx and they geuinely felt bad for me. they didn't need to because atleast i'm glad they had a good experience.

&amp;#x200B;

So after this pokemon go fest i Left with a total of:

&amp;#x200B;

3 new Pokedex entries (due to trades and jirachi)

2 shinies of which one I already had.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I do fully realize that this is not probably the average result anyone received today and that i'm the odd straw in there I am left with the question: was this worth my money and time? I feel not and today left a bitter taste which i cannot swallow anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a paid event. 44 euro's to be exact. (that's roughly 50 USD) i will leave out costs like fuel / hotels / on site purchases and so on... what is to be expected for this amount of money. What can we expect for that amount of money? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can we expect to have decent cell coverage? or above average? I mean I get it. It is crowded alot of people in a small area things get stress tested, but is it too much to ask for atleast a decent cell coverage which is not game breaking. That means slow game experience is allowed but no freezes

&amp;#x200B;

Can we expect a bug free experience? should we put up with the fact that an exclusive pokemon is not catchable witout work-arounds leaving people bummed out if they do not know how to cope with it.

&amp;#x200B;

and finally:

&amp;#x200B;

Can we expect to get a good Return on Investment on shinies? I mean people go to a go fest to catch exclusive pokemon. So did I. We got Jirachi, Carnivine and to some extend Nidoran male shiny release (not a real shiny exclusive for a go fest). Are we to expect to catch atleast x amount of shinies which are otherwise hard to get? Should we expect boosted shiny rates or community day like results? When i'm asking myself this question I'm hesitant in answering because part of me feels that I am being too entitled in expecting something in return for my time and money. Then again I don't.... 44 euros is a lot of money. I can miss it and i''ve spent a multitude over the course of past 3 years of playing but still.... 44 euros for this....... and then i'm not even considering other costs and time spend....

&amp;#x200B;

To end this post I would like to thank the great company I was with today which made the experience slightly better. I was in good company, I spoke to lots of people from all around europe (and the odd American even). They stuck with me in the worst of times and put up with my ever increasing saltiness over the course of today.

&amp;#x200B;

Again Niantic Support has been emailed in the hopes to getting atleast some reimbursement, but todays experiences wasted the game for me. The game I loved playing the past years deceived me over and over again and today was the final push....

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading. Obviously not a native English speaker but i'm sure my point comes accross.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr (well because mega all of text): Todays Go Fest in Dortmund was a very very bitter experience. inability to play / imbearable play experience during the first 4 hours, almost missed out on Jirachi and catching a whopping 2 shinies over the course of 10 hours playing and a travel time of 6 hours have me decided to quit the game. This a paid event (44EUR/50USD) for which we are supposed to expect more of.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;See this as a sort of open letter to Niantic (a summarized version has been mailed to support to which I have yet to receive a reply to)....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited about today, went to bed early but barely was able to sleep. Like a kid dreaming for santa.... It was my first go fest (been to some safari zones before). Since Dortmund is not around the corner I had my alarm set to 3:30 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm clock goes off I wake up and get ready to jump in the car. After a nice car ride of 3 hours (praise German Highways w/o speed limits (on most parts)) I found myself a nice parking spot near the kaiserhain gate entrance. I met up with some friends and made ourselves ready to make a great day and have a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clock ticks 8 am we&amp;#39;re all psyched and people start walking through the park like zombies. I tried to pay some attention to the amount of detail they put up into the decoration.

Remember when shiny lapras made its first appearance? Spoofers had a field day. They literally sniped as many as they could before Niantic changed the task. Niantic cleaned it up with a lapras day but the damage had already been done. An ultra rare shiny from tasks will probably never be seen again. 

Then there was the lake trio incident. Having them spawn in the wild was game changing. Thos was something many of us had long been waiting for and that too didn't go over well because again spoofers and bots destroyed yet another great feature. I hope TPC is taking note on this crap.

With so many players hitting the level cap (and I imagine more after next weeks event is finished) I understand that players are hungry for more progression. It’s one of the biggest requests I see out there.

It’s my understanding that Ingress has some form of Prestige system a la Call of Duty where once you hit level cap (40 in this case) you can reset back to level 1 but still keep certain things.

Personally I think you should still be able to see Pokémon up to level 30 (35 w/ weather boost), keep your items, dex, medals, stats, etc. Just make me earn 20m again and give me a bronze border around my name (like the medals). Get to 40 again and get a silver border. Again, gold. Etc. etc.

Anyway, with progression after 40 still being tracked to some degree and highly requested, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the XP you’ve been accumulating after 40 automatically bump you to wherever you would be relative to the new levels. In the example I give above, at level 40 with 26m XP, you would be bumped to Bronze border, level 34.

The gyms will be customizable, which will possibly grant a considerable income to Niantic.   Each successful defence will earn the defender appropiate rewards, and defending will have a badge of it’s own, same for the victorious attackers. It is a win win for everyone, players will have the satisfaction of a new achievement, Niantic will enjoy the increased income.&lt;/p&gt;

You guys think that an actual gym leader system can be added? Let me explain...

So far gyms are in defined places and people of different faction can battle other's mons and ""capture"" the gym for their team. 

What if, for a certain amount of time passed in that gym you'd get tokens. Those would be counted at the end of every week, two weeks, even month maybe and the player with the most amount of tokens will be elected as an actual gym leader. 

The winner will be highlighted on the map for everyone (only when he's playing ofc, and not during community days and when he's offline either, wouldn't like to be asked to battle mid groceries).

That would implie gym badges (unlike the one we already have but something more like Rome gym badge or New York gym badge) and possibly getting more people into fighting gyms since everyone has a new goal aside from the coins.

Must admit this has it's flaws... Once someone is gym leader they might not play for a while (solution: might switch gym leader after 2/3 days of inactivity and elect the 2nd in the leaderboard per tokens), plus this might be impractical for smaller towns :/.

There can also be some abilities like Sunny Day or Rain Dance to the cost of some energy in PVP battles for 6v6 battles making them more intense; this will be unlocked with stardust and candy because that’s how second charge moves at unlocked. This more competitive way of PVP will open doors to leaderboards( yes I’m being serious). To rank up in the leaderboards you will battle a maximum of 5 people a day randomly searched so you can’t just battle yourself and win all the time. I decided to put a maximum so it’s based on skill and not someone playing 24/7. With leaderboards, there could be some rewards which I thought it was good to put Megastones and rings. I think mega evolutions are only good for pvp because gym defending and attacking they won’t be that good. When a trainer gets a top leaderboard ranking of a season, he would then be able to choose either a ring or stone of a Pokémon type available in game. Mega evolutions require you to have a bond with your Pokémon so you will need to have walked or walk 150km with your Pokémon and win 750 gym battles or 500 to be able to mega evolve it during pvp battles. It would be good to start off with some mega evolutions like Lucario, charizard and starters. I thought it might be too soon to add them but since Alola forms are in game alredy, I think they could add mega evolutions, too.

It's a great improvement over previous year's server-crashing fights with ticket bots. However, **this new system still gives people with multiple accounts an advantage of getting picked over someone who is playing with just one account.**

It sucks when I see someone in my local POGO community gloat about how they managed to win a lottery on one of their spare accounts, and was therefore able to go. Meanwhile others (and I) continued with the anxiety of waiting for the next  lottery wave.

I was lucky enough to go to GoFest (Chicago). I had a blast, but I noticed there were a lot of people walking around with 2+ phones. A few people even had 4+ phones strapped on a well-engineered board. Sure, some of them might be helping a friend who can't make it go GoFest after buying a ticket, but some of them are also multi-account holders.

I'm also worried that if this lottery system continues as-is, it'll encourage folks to register for multiple accounts just so they can have more entries in the pot for future GoFests.

**I understand the TOS is grey on whether multiple accounts count as cheating, but the whole point of GoFest is for many individual human trainers to gather together for a common festival.

The San-Francisco based event clock doesn't work almost anywhere else, and I think changes need to be made. I'd like to hear more worldwide opinions on the matter.

I think niantic blocks all indirect data from google fit.
So if you walk with google fit on your phone you get rewarded with the distance you walked if the pokemon go app is closed. but if you get the data from another app like mi fit, it gets denied.

first off: i know there are posts about this topic, i have read them. I've tried their solutions and suggestions.

The problem is with a Huawei P10, fresh install, Android 8.0. It has nothing but the standard apps installed, plus google fit and PoGo. I have logged into google fit with the same account as PoGo. The mail address used is a @gmail.com. Clearing cache of every google app, pogo app didn't work. Reinstalling google fit and pogo didn't work. Both apps have all permissions they can have.

&amp;#x200B;

When i try to activate adventure sync in PoGo, it asks me to choose my account, after i choose it it just keeps showing me the loading icon in a white box. I tried it on another phone, same thing happens. Logging in with another PoGo account works fine and lets me activate adventure sync for that account.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea where to go from here. It seems that something in google fit is preventing it from properly linking pogo. When i go to connected apps, under fitness apps Pogo doesn't show, when i set it to all apps &amp; devices pogo shows with a generic android icon.

&amp;#x200B;

Any one any fresh ideas? I cannot find any settings in google fit that i would identify as being globally present and that might prevent a link.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas are appreciated at this point...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

Umbreon,Vaporeon and the 5 I don't know about.

The top cp of the 5 from my research goes tooooooooooo................... SLYVEON!!!!!!!! It also has the top cp of all the evolutions. So,to be fair, Slyveon is the the most powerful.

Im hoping bringing this up and somewhat ranting about my views/opinions/observances will help bring up the community to start helping fix this serious issue with the game and how Niantic handles their company. 
&amp;nbsp;
Just like always Niantic has gone to the typical fashion of drawing out the gameplay in a very poor fashion. After releasing the Alolan shinies the typical Alolan spawns are now completely barren. This mirrors previous occurrences of a shiny being added to the game and it being almost put into extinction for habitat spawns. This move exists solely to drag our gameplay rather than to add more reason to play. The fear is that if the new shiny Pokemon were to continue spawning at its normal rates in its normal locations, players would get more shinies quicker and thus exit the game faster. This would in turn cause Niantic to lose money. In the real world, this fear is unfounded as that’s not how algorithms actually work but Niantic was once a branch of Google so money grubbing is all they care about. Yes i am aware of neat changes but I’m not talking about nests. I can go into a location since Alolans were spawning wild and consistently see them in this spawn from launch to pre-event. Now, post-event they no longer exist. This isn’t a nest change or a biome change. This is solely a spawn rate change to get Niantic more money. Please help put an end to these kinds of decisions by this company. 
&amp;nbsp;
And no I’m not complaining because I didn’t get all of the shiny Alolans as I don’t care since it gives me reason to play. I actually got the only shiny Alolan that I even wanted and a pretty decent one at that. This has to do with the fact that they make massive gameplay changes just to force players to spend more money and time on a game that shouldn’t be necessary besides the company being overly money hungry.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of goes along with the post I made not too long ago but at the same time this is a very different post.
